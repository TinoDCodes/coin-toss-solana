# Coin Toss Solana

This repository contains a fully functional, feature-rich decentralized application (DApp) built for betting on coin toss events on the Solana blockchain. Users can connect their Solana wallets and place bets using a custom SPL token called Toss Coin. Coin toss events occur every hour, offering frequent opportunities for engagement. This DApp integrates with a Supabase backend for managing off-chain data and leverages Solana smart contracts for on-chain operations.

## Coin Toss Solana Program

This Solana program, written in Rust using the Anchor framework, provides a secure and efficient way to handle token-based betting events. The program supports the following core functionalities:

### Key Features

1. **Place Bet**
Users can place bets by staking tokens. Each bet is tied to a unique `bet_id` and includes details such as stake amount and odds. User stakes are securely transferred into an on-chain coin vault.

2. **Settle Bet**
After a betting event concludes, this feature calculates payouts based on the odds and distributes tokens from the coin vault to the winner's account. It also ensures the validity of the payout process.

3. **Vault Management**
The program includes functionality to handle deposits and withdrawals from the coin vault, ensuring proper tracking of vault balances.

### Program Highlights

 - **Global Constants**
   - `ADMIN_PUBKEY`: Authorizes administrative actions.
   - `PAYOUT_AUTHORITY`: Ensures payouts are securely authorized.
   - `MAX_BET_ID_LENGTH`: Restricts bet ID length for consistency and security.

- **Instruction Handlers**
   - **Initialization**: Sets up necessary accounts, including a token vault and PDA (Program Derived Address).
   - **Token Transfers**: Handles deposits and withdrawals securely using CPI (Cross-Program Invocation).
   - **Bet Management**: Enables users to place bets, processes payouts, and manages bet accounts.

- **Error Handling**
   Built-in validation, such as ensuring bet IDs do not exceed the allowed length and protecting vault operations with authorized access only.

### Technical Details

The program uses Anchor's account structures to manage user and vault data, ensuring all operations adhere to Solana's security best practices. Below are some key elements implemented in the code:

- **Token Vaults**: A PDA-owned token account securely holds user stakes until a payout or withdrawal is processed.
- **Bet Payout Calculation**: Odds are scaled for precision (e.g., scaled by `10^3`), and payouts are derived as `stake Ã— odds / 1000`.
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Uses `CpiContext` for token transfers, ensuring smooth integration with the SPL Token program.

### Example Use Cases

1. **User Places a Bet**
   - Stake tokens via the `place_bet` instruction.
   - Tokens are securely transferred to the vault, and a user bet account is initialized.

2. **Settle a Bet**
   - The `process_bet_payout` instruction calculates the payout and transfers tokens from the vault to the winner.

3. **Vault Operations**
   - Admin can deposit or withdraw tokens from the coin vault using `transfer_in` and `transfer_out` instructions.

### Anchor Commands

You can use any normal anchor commands. Either move to the `coin_toss` directory and run the `anchor` command or prefix the command with `pnpm`, eg: `pnpm anchor`.

#### Sync the program ID
This command creates a new keypair in the `coin_toss/target/deploy` directory, saves the address to the Anchor config file, and updates the `declare_id!` macro in the `./src/lib.rs` file of the program. Ensure to manually update the constant in `coin_toss/lib/basic-exports.ts` to match the new program ID.

```bash
pnpm anchor keys sync
```

#### Build the program
```bash
pnpm anchor build
```

#### Start a local validator with the program deployed
```bash
pnpm anchor localnet
```

#### Run tests
```bash
pnpm anchor test
```

#### Deploy to Devnet
```bash
pnpm anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
```


## Upgrading Solana Program

### Steps to Upgrade

1. Check the size of the new program build:
   ```bash
   ls -lh target/deploy/<program>.so
   ```

2. Check the size of the deployed program:
   ```bash
   solana program show <PROGRAM_ID>
   ```

3. Extend the size of the deployed program (if required):
   ```bash
   solana program extend <PROGRAM_ID> <BYTES_SIZE>
   ```

4. Upgrade the program on-chain:
   ```bash
   anchor upgrade --provider.cluster <CLUSTER> --program-id <PROGRAM_ID> target/deploy/<PROGRAM>.so
   ```
